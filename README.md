## Getting Started

Before you can run the Behrouz Restaurant website locally or make any contributions, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/its-nishant320/Behrouz-Royal-Restaurant>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration**: Create a configuration file (e.g., `.env`) to store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other environment-specific variables. Make sure to provide appropriate values for your development environment.

4. **Database Setup**: If you are working on a feature that involves database access, you'll need to set up a MongoDB instance and configure the connection in the code.

5. **Run the Application**: Use the following command to start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The website should now be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
